# givesendgo donation scraper
Inspired by the Canadian 2022 Freedom convoy, this short script lets you save all the publicly available information on all donations for a givesendgo campaign.

The py file is pretty well commented. as long as you can get selenium working correctly you should be good to go.

The data for the freedom convoy has been moved to https://github.com/noskillsben/freedom_convoy_2022_donation_scrape and the files will be removed from this repository
