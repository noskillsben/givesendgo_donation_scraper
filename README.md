# givesendgo donation scraper

## Update 2022-03-01
Looks like givesendgo blocked the url to only accept local requests + removed the more recent donations button so unfortunatly this scraper will no longer work and other than refreshing a page 24/7 and grabbing new comments from there it looks like scraping the donations is done for now.

Inspired by the Canadian 2022 Freedom convoy, this short script lets you save all the publicly available information on all donations for a givesendgo campaign.

The py file is pretty well commented. as long as you can get selenium working correctly you should be good to go.

The data for the freedom convoy has been moved to https://github.com/noskillsben/freedom_convoy_2022_donation_scrape and the files will be removed from this repository
